# password-generator
Password Generator that creates a randomly generated password with 6 parameters:

5) symbols / special characters
6) and user-inputted phrase

Uses React.js and Node.js as the framework and CSS as the styling.

Max Character Limit can be set but for the sake of the CSS styling, it was set at 22 characters, which can obviously be changed

If the phrase added by the user matches the character limit set by the user (what's the point of using this then???), return the phrase as it is
